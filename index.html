								ENG2003: Effective Engineering Communication <br />
								Assignment 2 <br />
								<img src="images/coverLetter.png" width="800"/>
								<p align="left">This assignment strengthened professional correspondence by learning from sample documents and adhering to verbal and written 
									instructions in a professional context. The main challenge in drafting a successful cover letter is in conveying 
									the required information in a concise and courteous manner while making it personalized. Composing this letter also took me through the 
									good practice of addressing companies by personalized letters for the specific company/recruiter. The perfect cover letter can only be crafted by 
									knowing the right practices and getting constructive feedback. This assignment enabled me to hone my writing skills and understand
								the anatomy of a cover letter well.   </p>

								<p align="left">The objective of this assignment was to explain emerging technology to a variety of audiences efficiently using appropriate methods.
									 The main challenge here was explaining the same technical concept to two contrasting audiences; high school students and experts in the field.
									I began by preparing a rough layout of the info to be presented. I prepared the content by adhering to the 7 C's to keep it clear and concise while considering the ethos, logos and pathos of
									the message being shared. The axioms of communication guided the process to address all the key points. I proceeded to design these
									documents being mindful of each audience. Figures were added to support the understanding of the content. This assignment was fun and 
									insightful at the same time. Explaining the same info to different kind of people tuned my writing skills to create audience-centred content. </p>

								<br />
								<p align="left">The objective of this assignment was to develop, edit and present a technical document, including tables and figures, in written form. 
									  This was my first time preparing a ten page technical report in an academic style. It refined my technical language and vocabulary since it was challenging to
									  to communicate to the reader in a clear and cohesive manner. An important part of the assignment was feedback. The peer review gave constructive feedback
									  as per the rubric and also gave an opportunity to explore different styles among my peers. The report definitely contributed the most to my
									  growth as an effective communicator. Also, I prepared this report in LaTeX and came out of this submission a TeX god.</p>

								Software Requirements Specification Document <br />
								<br />
								<embed src="images/srs-doc.pdf#toolbar=0" width="70%" height="1000px"><br />
								<br />
								<p align="left">This is a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document prepared for a Java project for the course EECS2311. It is a document that outlines the 
										features and intended behaviour of the software prepared before kick-starting a project, essentially an agreement between the client and the developer.
										Software documentation is very crucial since it ensures teams and stakeholders are on the same page regarding the requirements, scope and constraints.
										Since this is a blueprint for the project, it was essential to keep the language concise and ensure all the required information was conveyed.
										Writing this document was a warmup for the technical report. The feedback on our document was positive and was graded well. 
										This document drastically improved my technical communication ability. </p>
